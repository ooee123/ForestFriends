/** \brief This class encapsulates a FreeRTOS queue which transmits data from one RTOS 
 *  task to another. 
 * 
 *  Since multithreaded tasks must not use unprotected shared data items 
 *  for communication, queues are a primary means of intertask communication. Other
 *  means include shared data items (see frt_shared_data.h) and carrier pigeons. 
 *  The use of a C++ class template allows the compiler to check that you're putting 
 *  the right type of data into each queue and getting the right type of data out, 
 *  thus helping to prevent programming mistakes that can corrupt your data. 
 * 
 *  As a template class, <tt>frt_queue<data_type></tt> can be used to make queues which
 *  hold data of many types. "Plain Old Data" types such as \c bool or \c uint16_t are 
 *  supported, of course. But you can also use queues which hold compound data types. 
 *  For example, if you have <tt>class my_data</tt> which holds several measurements 
 *  together in an object, you can make a queue for \c my_data objects with 
 *  <tt>frt_queue<my_data></tt>.  Each item in the queue will then hold several 
 *  measurements. 
 *  The size of FreeRTOS queues is limited to 255 items in 8-bit microcontrollers
 *  whose \c portBASE_TYPE is an 8-bit number. This is a FreeRTOS feature. 
 * 
 *  Normal writing and reading are done with methods \c put() and \c get(). 
 *  Normal writing means that the sending task must wait until there is empty space in
 *  the queue, and then it puts a data item into the "back" of the queue, where "back"
 *  means that the item in the back of the queue will be read after all items that were
 *  previously put into the queue have been read. Normal reading means that when an 
 *  item is read from the front of the queue, it will then be removed, making space for
 *  more items at the back. This process is often used to synchronize tasks, as the
 *  reading task's \c get() method blocks, meaning that the reading task gets
 *  stuck waiting for an item to arrive in the queue; it won't do anything useful until
 *  new data has been read. Note that this is acceptable behavior in an RTOS because
 *  the RTOS scheduler will ensure that other tasks get to run even while the reading
 *  task is blocking itself waiting for data. 
 * 
 *  In some cases, one may need to use less normal reading and writing methods. Methods
 *  whose name begins with \c ISR_ are to be used only within a hardware interrupt
 *  service routine. If one needs to put data at the front of the queue instead of the
 *  back, use \c butt_in() instead of \c put(). If one needs to read data from the
 *  queue without removing that data, the \c look_at() method allows this to be done. 
 *  If something particularly unusual needs to be done with the queue, one can use the
 *  method \c get_handle() to retrieve the handle used by the C language functions in
 *  FreeRTOS to access the frt_queue object's underlying data structure directly. 
 * 
 *  \section Usage
 *  The following bits of code show how to set up and use a queue to transfer data of
 *  type \c uint16_t 
 *  from one hypothetical task called \c task_A to another called \c task_B.
 *  
 * In the file which contains \c main() we create a pointer to a queue and use the 
 * \c new operator to create the queue itself. The constructor of the 
 * \c frt_queue<uint16_t> class is given the number of items in the queue (10) and a
 * pointer to a serial port object named \c serial_port that has previously been 
 * created: 
 *  \code 
 *  frt_queue<uint16_t>* p_my_queue;
 *  ...
 *  main ()
 *  {
 *      ...
 *      p_my_queue = new frt_queue<uint16_t> (10, &serial_port);
 *  }
 *  \endcode
 *  In a header file which is read by all the source files in the project we re-declare
 *  the queue pointer with the keyword \c extern to make it globally accessible in all
 *  files that \c \#include this header file:
 *  \code
 *  extern frt_queue<uint16_t>* p_my_queue;
 *  \endcode
 *  In the sending task, data is put into the queue:
 *  \code
 *  uint16_t a_data_item;
 *  ...
 *  p_my_queue->put (a_data_item);
 *  \endcode
 *  In the receiving task, data is read from the queue. In typical usage, the call to
 *  \c get() will block the receiving task until data is put into the queue by the
 *  sending task:
 *  \code
 *  uint16_t got_data;
 *  ...
 *  got_data = p_my_queue->get ();
 *  \endcode
